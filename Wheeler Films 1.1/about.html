    <center><p class="about_T"> It started with a birthday. </p></center>
    <center><p class="about_P"> Two boys, ages 8 and 10, wanted to give their dad something cool for his birthday. They thought of an idea. They wanted to make a movie. All they had to film with was a Nintendo 2DS. But they were determined. The finished product was one they were pround of, though it was not as good as the ones they would make in the future. They could only dream of the wild possibilties they would eventually make.</p></center>
